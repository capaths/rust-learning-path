# References

A **data race** is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

## Rules

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.
