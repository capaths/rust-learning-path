## Guessing game

- Some items in the standard library are brought to the scope of every program,
these are called the **prelude**.
- Those that are not must be imported explicitly using a ``use`` statement.
- By default, variables are immutable, but you can make them mutable by prefixing
them with ``mut``.
- Functions after a type and two colons are called **associated functions**, like
``String::new()``, which is an associated function of the type ``String``.
