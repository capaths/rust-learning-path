# Variables

- Variables are immutable by default.
- Variables can be mutable by prefixing them with ``mut``.
- Constants are like immutable variables, but:
  - The cannot be set as mutable.
  - Can be declared anywhere, including the global scope.
  - Can only be set to a constant expression that does not change at runtime.
